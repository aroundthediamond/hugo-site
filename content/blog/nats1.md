With the rest of the East struggling to stay afloat, the injured Nationals relied on an unlikely group of hitters to carry them to the first place position in the division.  Trea Turner, Josh Harrison, and Yadiel Hernandez all enjoyed huge weeks and propelled Washington to a 4 game win streak.

**WAS @ NYM**


**Game 3**

In the series finale Washington sent Patrick Corbin out to face the Mets’ Taijuan Walker.  Going along with the theme of his season, Corbin got lit up and failed to go past the 4th inning mark.  The southpaw was plagued by the longball, giving up 2 on the day to J.D. Davis and Pete Alonso.  He ended the day with 4 earned on 7 hits.  Walker was filthy and went 7 innings, baffling the Washington order and holding them to just 3 hits.  It’s interesting to recognize Austin  Voth’s performance, as he went 3 innings and struck out 4 in relief.  It definitely looks as if Voth, with his 2.08 ERA, has earned himself a spot start in the future.  The Nats offense was quiet with the exception of Yadiel Hernandez, who got his big week started with a 2-2 performance along with a pair of walks.
